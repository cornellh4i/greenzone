### Application
The Hack4Impact team at Cornell aims to help GreenZone by **designing & developing a web-application** that will: 

1. Collect and organize geoJSON map data from partners, ensuring **accurate** and up-to-date **information**.
2. **Display** **data** as heat maps or graphs on an interactive map of Mongolia, with customizable layers based on user filters (e.g., county, district, carrying capacity).
3. **Optimize** the web app for reliable **performance** in **areas** with **limited** **internet** connectivity, to allow access for nomadic herders in remote locations.
4. Enable data persistence, allowing users to **view** **historical** **trends** in rangeland health over time.
