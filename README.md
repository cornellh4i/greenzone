### What is GreenZone?
Knowledge of where the next major rangeland degradation will occur is crucial to the herders and policymakers that depend on this information. GreenZone aims to create a Carrying Capacity Early Warning System for Mongolian rangelands to combat degradation caused by overgrazing and climate change. 

### What is this Fancy Github Stuff? 
The Hack4Impact team at Cornell aims to help GreenZone by **designing & developing a web-application** that will: 
1. Collect and organize geoJSON map data from partners, ensuring **accurate** and up-to-date **information**.
2. **Display** **data** as heat maps or graphs on an interactive map of Mongolia, with customizable layers based on user filters - Using Leaflet and D3
3. **Optimize** the web app for reliable **performance** in **areas** with **limited** **internet** connectivity, to allow access for nomadic herders in remote locations. - Using Next.js
4. Enable data persistence, allowing users to **view** **historical** **trends** in rangeland health over time. -Using MongoDB


### Why is this Project Useful?
These visualizations will provide the most up-to-date information about how healthy the rangelands are. Herders, government officials, NGO officers, insurance risk analysts, and data analysts will use this information to make informed decisions regarding rangeland management and how to prevent overexploitation (overgrazing & desertification). This will make this data more easily accessible to the public.
